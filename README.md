# Magist Partnership
## Analysis of proposed partnership with online marketplace Magist
This project was run in July 2024 as part of the WBS CODING SCHOOL Data Analysis Bootcamp.

The goal is to analyse Magist's company records (sales, customer and product information, etc.) to determine the suitability of a three-year partnership to support expansion of the "employer" Eniac into the Brazilian market.

Delivery on this project consisted of a five-minute presentation to the (fictional) CEO of Eniac, whether our team supports partnership with Magist for the proposed market expansion.

The Tableau workbook used in this project is available to view on my [Tableau Public profile](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/christopher.galloway5578/viz/New_Magist/).

## Languages and Libraries Used

Tableau Public
Google Slides

## Key Learnings
This project offered the chance to freely explore a database to answer an open-ended question. While some questions were proposed by the program to get us asking questions, the great challenge lay in coming up with additional questions to pose, as well as learning how to write SQL queries to answer them. 

The value of teamwork showed itself greatly, as performing the work as a new-comer to data analysis within one week meant that no one person could accomplish everything alone.

## Additional Reflections
I would like to thank my teammates Cintia and Lisardo for their efforts in meeting this challenge and moving forward in our discovery of data analysis methods and practices.
